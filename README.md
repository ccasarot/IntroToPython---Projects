# IntroToPython---Projects
Collection of two python based projects, from the course "02631 Introduction to Programming and Data Processing"

# Content
The introductory programming course at DTU provides options in both Python and Matlab. I personally opted for Python to broaden my language repertoire beyond Matlab. The course is composed of exercise sessions, projects, and a final exam. This repository contains the two projects I completed during the course, each stored in their respective folders.
The assignment details for these projects can be found in the "Projects - Assignment" PDF. Project one, titled "Bacteria Data Analysis" (page 3), and project two, titled "Beam deflection" (page 13), involved creating concise programs with basic user interfaces for data handling and calculations (refer to the descriptions below).
These projects were collaborative efforts with another DTU student, Marica Sudano (s225578), as indicated in the scripts.
To use the programs the user should download the folder and open the "mainScript" file.

# Description
A more in detail description of the projects is available in the "Projects - Assignment" PDF file.
1) Project one, Bacteria Data Analysis: Here a simple data analysis of some bacteria is performed. The data is loaded from a txt file (for example test.txt), and it is possible to filter the data, perform simple statistics calculations, and plot it trought an interactive menu.
2) Project two, Beam deflection: Create a beam geomery, characterized by beam length and type and position of the supports. Declare position and intensity of loads and calculate the deflection. One can modify all the parameters and see the different results, and plot the beam deflection shape. The beam data can also be loaded, an example is given with the "test.csv" file.
